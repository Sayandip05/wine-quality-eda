# 🍷 Wine Quality - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on performing **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** on the popular **Wine Quality dataset**.  
The goal is to explore data patterns, visualize relationships, and uncover insights that may affect wine quality ratings.  

## 🎯 Objectives
- Load and clean the dataset  
- Perform **descriptive statistics** and **data distribution analysis**  
- Visualize relationships between wine chemical properties and quality  
- Identify correlations and patterns in the data  
- Prepare a foundation for future ML modeling  

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries Used
- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy)  
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn** for data visualization  
- **Jupyter Notebook** for analysis  

## 📊 Key Insights (Examples to Include Later)
- How acidity, alcohol, and sugar levels influence wine quality  
- Which features have the strongest correlation with wine ratings  
- Distribution of wine quality scores across the dataset
